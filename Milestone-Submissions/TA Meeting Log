TA meetings
11/1/2022

Note: Every one must show up to TA meetings for evaluation

All future meetings:
1st: What we've done so far, what the plan is, who has done what
2nd: Deliverables must be present at every meeting
    -Release notes for each 

-Main branch code must be working
-Branch for each feature/user story
-Each issue within a user story has its own branch
-Commit message must make sense, never combine all features in one commit
-2-3 mcommits per week per person
-All code goes in the code folder
-Do not overload one person alone
-Release notes done for each meeting
-Next recitations will cover testinging and deployment
-Project creation can be an epic, each feature within will be a user story, issues nested within user stories.
