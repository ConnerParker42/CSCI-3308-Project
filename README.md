 - Application name: Ping-Pong
 - Application description:  A messaging app with a haptic, audio response considered the “ping”.  User is able to create an account, and only users with accounts in the database can login on the login page.  After being logged in, the user can view all messages inclusive of that user based on messages sent to the database for that user.  User can add other users.
 - Vision statement: For the student on the go, who wants to streamline their communications between all of their classmates, TAs, and Professors.  Ping-pong is a messaging app that provides users with easy and efficient means of public and private communication. Unlike Twitter, our product will be streamlined and frictionless as the user navigates through scheduling and communications across classes, across campus. Ping-Pong it.
 - Development Methodology: Agile Methodology. Using Github Projects for assignment and distribution of sprints and epochs.
 - Communication Plan: We will mostly use Discord to communicate and collaborate, as well as comments and notes in Github Pages.  Pull requests are expected to be used prior to merging working repositories with the main project folder.  We’ll ping members on Discord when we’ve tagged them to review each pull request.
- Meeting Plan:
    - Team Meeting - We will meet at 3:00 PM on Tuesdays remotely.
    - TA Meeting - We will meet with our TA at 4:10 PM on Tuesdays remotely.
